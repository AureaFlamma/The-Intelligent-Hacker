## Hardware
Computers on a network are connected to a router. Router is connected to a modem which converts our data into data manageable by a phone network (1). The phone network carries the data to an Internet Service Provider. ISP's manage special routers which connect to other ISPs' routers.

(1) - dial-up internet (now obsolete), DSL and Cable use the telephone network. Wireless and Fibreoptic don't- but the underlying mechanics are the same regardless of the kind of connection. 
## OSI Model


## Main protocols
- IP:
	- IPv4 (32 bits)
	- IPv6 (128 bit)
- TCP
- DNS
- SSL/TLS
- HTTP/HTTPS
- TLS - security (used in HTTPs)

## Caching

## Security and authorisation



## Questions
- Do application layer protocols (HTTP and SMTP) translate human readable data into computer-readable data? 
- RE: OSI Model - difference between same network and different networks re: the layers. 
- All other protocols I've missed.
- Less essential: so the Web is different to email and IRC services huh? 
- HTTPS:
