In HTTP/2, HOL blocking is resolved by splitting each request and response into frames. Each frame is assigned a stream number in its frame header (different to HTTP header and chunking header) . Request and response have different stream numbers, but their numbers are in relation to each other such. Thus, it is possible for client to match the data it is receiving to a particular request it had sent, without a need for sequentiality. Without sequentiality, slow responses do not block any other responses.
