### Status line
1. Requests
	- HTTP Method
	- Request URI
	- HTTP Version
2. Responses
	- HTTP Version
	- Status Code
	- Reason Phrase
### HTTP Methods
Found on requests
- **GET** - clients requests data from server
- **POST** - client adds data to server
- **PUT** - client replaces data on server
- **DELETE** - client deletes data from server
- **HEAD** - clients requests only the headers that would be returned if the request was `GET`. Useful for seeing if the resource which is about to be sent is a large one (by looking at `Content-Length` response header)
### Status codes
Found on responses
- **1xx** Informational
- **2xx** Success
- **3xx** Redirect
- **4xx** Client Error
- **5xx** Server Error
#### Common status codes
- 200 OK
- 201 OK created
- 301 Moved to new URL
- 304 Not modified (Cached version)
- 400 Bad request
- 401 Unauthorised
- 404 Not found
- 500 Internal server error
### Headers
[List of all HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)
#### Request
- `Cookie` - contains stored HTTP cookies associated with the server (i.e. previously sent by the server with the `Set-Cookie` header or set in JavaScript using `Document.cookie`).
- `Accept` - Specifies the media type that the client is willing to receive from the server. Part of [[content negotiation]]
- `Accept-Encoding` - Indicates the content encoding method (e.g. gzip, deflate) the client can understand. Part of [[content negotiation]]
- `Accept-Language` - Specifies preference for a natural language. Part of [[content negotiation]]. You can set the preference in your browser settings. Usually browsers will include in this header a list of languages with decreasing `q` values, indicating order of preference for languages. E.g.
```
Accept-Language: fr,la;q=0.8,en-GB;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
```
  It reads: Latin, then French at 0.8 importance, then British english at 0.5 importance, then English at 0.3 importance.
  - `Authorization` Contains the credentials to authenticate a user agent with a server. Usually client sends first request without `Authorisation` header, server replies with `401 Unauthorized` and `WWW-Authenticate` header. 
  - `Cache-Control` holds directives (instructions) that control caching in browser and middleware (Proxies, CDNs). Present in both Request and Response headers.
  - `Connection` indicates whether the client wants the connection to stay open (`Connection: keep alive`) or be closed (`Connection: close`) after the current transaction. Rarely used in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
  - `Host` specifies the host and TCP port number of the server to which the request is being sent. Port number can be ommited, in which case the default port is implied (e.g., `443` for an HTTPS URL, and `80` for an HTTP URL).
  - `If-Modified-Since` request HTTP header makes the request conditional: the server sends back the requested resource, with a `200` status, only if it has been last modified after the given date. If the resource has not been modified since, the response is a `304` without any body.
  - `If-None-Match` makes the request conditional. For `GET` and `HEAD` methods, the server will return the requested resource, with a `200` status, only if it doesn't have an `ETag` matching the given ones. For other methods, the request will be processed only if the eventually existing resource's `ETag` doesn't match any of the values listed.
  - `Referer` (sic) contains the URL of the website from which the request was made. Unlike `Origin`, which contains only protocol and domain name, `Referer` contains protocol, domain, port (sometimes), path and query string.
  - `Origin` contains domain from which request was made
```
// Let's say we are visiting example.com and clicking a link that takes us to example2.com. The request sent to example2.com's server will be:
    
Referer: https://example.com/page1.html?query=123
Origin: https://example.com
```
- `User-Agent` contains info about browser and OS:
```
User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0
```

#### Response
- `Accept-Control-Allow-Origin` Indicates which origin the resource can be shared with. Connected to the `Origin` request header. 
- `Cache-Control` holds directives (instructions) that control caching in browser and middleware (Proxies, CDNs). Present in both Request and Response headers
- `Connection` indicates whether the server wants the connection to stay open (`Connection: keep alive`) or be closed (`Connection: close`) after the current transaction. Rarely used in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
- `ETag` Specifies the version of the resource. Requested with `If-None-Match` request header. Useful for not sending the same data multiple times (`GET`) and for version control (`PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`)
- `WWW-Authenticate` contains a list of authentication methods ("challenges") which might be used to gain access to a protected resource. 
- `Set-Cookie` Sends a cookie to the client so that the client can send it back later. Multiple Set-Cookie headers are permissable in single response. 
- `Expires` Indicates when the response is considered stale and needs to be revalidated. Used in caching. Similar to `Cache-Control` only older and less granular. If `Expires` and `Cache-Control` are both present, the latter takes precedence. 
- `Last-Modified` contains date and time when the resource was last modified. Used for caching. Similar to `ETag`, but less granular. Used as fallback to `ETag`.
- `Location` Used with redirects with `3xx` and `201 (Created)` Status codes. Indicates where the server wants the client to send requests to.
- `Server` contains information about the server. Equivalent to client's `User-Agent`. E.g.:
  `Server: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix)`
- `Transfer-Envoding` - indicates what for of encoding was used to safely transfer data. Similar to `Content-Encoding`, only applied to one transfer of information on a hop-by hop bsdid.
- `Vary` tells the client that the resource will vary depending on the specified header.
#### Representation and Payload
- `Content-Type` indicates the type of content being sent by server or client. If client sends wrong type of data to the server, the server may respond with `415 Unsupported Media Type`. 
  Example: `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`
- `Content-Encoding` Indicates what encodings have been applied to the payload and in what order. Helps receipient in decoding the data. 
- `Content-Length` Length of payload in bytes (octets)
- `Content-language` Describes the natural language of the intended audience of the resource.
- `Content-Location` Specifies a URL at which the sent resource can be accessed directly. Most often found on responses, rarely on requests. See [examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Location#examples)for more context. 
- `Content-Range` Indicates the part of a document that the server is returning. Useful for partial content requests. 
  Example: `Content-Range: bytes 200-1000/67589`
