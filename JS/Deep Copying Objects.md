There are several methods you can use to deep copy objects in JavaScript. Here are a few of them:

1. **Using `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`:** This approach involves converting the object to a JSON string and then parsing that string back into a new object.

```
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObject));
```

   This method is simple and works in most cases, but it has some limitations. It won't correctly copy object methods, Dates, RegExps, and other non-JSON values. It also won't handle circular references.

2. **Using a library like Lodash:** Lodash is a popular JavaScript library that provides a `cloneDeep()` function for deep copying objects.
```
const deepCopy = _.cloneDeep(originalObject);
```
   This method is reliable and handles a wider range of cases than the JSON methods, but it requires adding a dependency to your project.

3. **Using the structuredClone algorithm:** This is a built-in web platform API for deep cloning that can handle more types and correctly handles circular references. It's currently only available in browsers and is experimental in Node.js.
```
const deepCopy = structuredClone(originalObject);
```
   This method is the most robust, but it's not yet universally available in all environments.

4. **Using recursive function:** You can also write your own function to deep clone an object. This function would go through each property in the object and recursively clone its value if it's an object itself.
```
function deepClone(obj) {
 if (typeof obj !== 'object' || obj === null) {
   return obj; // Return the value if obj is not an object
 }

 let clone = Array.isArray(obj) ? [] : {};
 for (let key in obj) {
   clone[key] = deepClone(obj[key]);
 }

 return clone;
}
```
   This method gives you full control over the cloning process, but it's more complex and might not handle all edge cases.

Remember that deep copying objects can be expensive in terms of performance and memory, so it should only be done when necessary.
